            The parties in Congress are increasingly ideologically cohesive, yet majority-party
            defection on procedural votes is rising. I argue defections emerge as the party’s capacity to punish wanes.
            To
            test
            this theory, I introduce a graph-based measure of legislators’ financial reliance on the party donor
            network.
            Unlike ideology scores, the distribution of financial reliance has splintered in both parties, as
            obstructionist
            caucuses grow less reliant on their party’s network of corporate PACs. Such reliance predicts defections
            within-Congress, within- district, and even within obstructionist factions. With a difference-in-differences
            design, I show that these changes have circumscribed party leaders’ ability to punish, as the corporate
            dollar cost of voting against McCarthy’s 2023 speaker election was nearly half the cost Boehner’s defectors
            faced
            in 2015. I update the Conditional Party Government and cartel theories of Congress by demonstrating that
            positive agenda power depends not only on ideological homogeneity within the majority party, but also on
            party
            leaders’ punishment capacity. </p>

                Evaluation of Fraud Claims from the 2020 Trump Election Contests</a></strong> (with Justin Grimmer)

            Even years after the 2020 election, Donald Trump continues to claim that fraudulent and
            illegal votes cost him the 2020 election. In this paper we provide the most comprehensive assessment of his
            empirical claims to date. All of the claims we evaluate fail to provide evidence of fraud or illegal voting.
            Trump's claims of fraud or illegality are riddled with errors, hampered by misunderstandings about how to
            analyze official voter records, and filled with confusion about basic statistical techniques and concepts.
            Often, the claims are based on the casual impressions of what happens in a ``normal" election based on
            little more than intuitions. Worse yet, several claims are simply misstated by Trump's legal team or Trump.
            As a
            result, sometimes the public claims do not even match the weak evidence in Trump's legal challenges. This
            paper provides a resource for assessing many of the most prevalent claims made about the 2020 election and a
            guide to anticipating potential objections in future elections. </p>

    <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning: Do Politicians Optimize for Engagement on Twitter? </strong> [<a

            A large literature argues that social media encourages politicians to be polarizing,
            because such content receives greater user engagement. This assumes, however, that campaigns adjust their
            content based on what gets attention. We test this assumption with over 3.7 million tweets sent by all
            congressional candidates between 2019 and 2022. We introduce a reinforcement-learning-inspired design that
            examines
            whether candidates are more likely to repeat content after it goes viral. Using a matching estimator based
            on sentence embeddings, we compare each viral tweet to a near-identical non-viral tweet and estimate its
            effect
            on the similarity of subsequent messages. Contrary to the engagement-maximization hypothesis, we find that
            virality causes candidates to diverge from the content of viral tweets, both in meaning and topic. These
            effects
            are
            consistent across challengers and incumbents and are unrelated to ideology or electoral vulnerability ---
            even extreme candidates and those in safe districts do not systematically adjust content in response to
            engagement. These results temper concerns that user demand for polarizing or uncivil content encourages
            politicians to strategically supply such content. </p>

    <p><strong> The Distribution of Voter Ideology</a></strong> (with Avi Acharya and Justin Grimmer) [draft coming
        soon] </p>
    <details>
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-style: italic;">Abstract</summary>
        <p>
            We introduce a simple, fast, and accurate methodology for estimating the distribution of
            voter ideology on the same scale as the candidates competing in those elections: a regression of vote shares
            to the left of a midpoint in a precinct on the ideological midpoint between candidates competing in the
            elections in that precinct. We prove a surprising result: if voters choose candidates based on ideological
            proximity and if a straightforward assumption about candidate positioning holds, then this estimator
            identifies
            the
            distribution of ideology in the public and can be consistently estimated with off-the-shelf methods like a
            kernel regression. This result holds even if we observe only a single election contest in each precinct.
